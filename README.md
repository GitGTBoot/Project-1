2018 Data Professional Job Market


 By George Oddoye , Vidhyanandhi Jegannathan  



Data Profession is becoming the “coolest” profession of the 21st century. There is overwhelming amount of information available in the academic arena and the job market to render us helpless, not knowing where to begin our search and how to narrow down information to make meaningful conclusions. 

The “Indeed Dataset “ created and maintained by Elroy on www.kaggle.com , https://www.kaggle.com/elroyggj/indeed-dataset-data-scientistanalystengineer , is  a fairly comprehensive  dataset about the various aspects of data professional job market across the US . Data displayed was regarding  job titles, job types,  names of job offering companies, location of companies,  type of industry for each company , salaries and necessary skills for job postings on www.indeed.com in 2018.

While researching for a meaningful topic for our project work , we were drawn to this dataset for  the most compelling reason, none other than the fact that we were currently enrolled in a Data Analytics Bootcamp to equip ourselves with skills to step into the job market very soon and knowing the market trend would be priceless.
